//https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/
//You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
//
//For example, given:
//s: "barfoothefoobarman"
//words: ["foo", "bar"]
//
//You should return the indices: [0,9].
//(order does not matter).
